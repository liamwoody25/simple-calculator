## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/liamwoody25/simple-calculator.git
cd simple-calculator

# Open index.html directly in your browser
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1. Launch the calculator in your browser.
2. Enter numbers and operators using the on-screen buttons or your keyboard.
3. Press `=` to compute the result.
4. Use `C` to clear the current input.

## üßÆ How It Works (Stack Logic Explained)

This calculator uses a **stack data structure** to evaluate expressions. When you enter numbers and operators:
- Numbers are pushed onto the stack.
- Operators are applied according to standard arithmetic precedence.
- The stack is processed from left to right, evaluating as per operator precedence rules.

Example:
```
Input: 3 + 5 √ó 2
Stack: [3, '+', 5, '√ó', 2]
Output: 13 (since 5 √ó 2 = 10, then 3 + 10 = 13)
```
